# *Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Text Tokenization* (But Were Afraid to Ask)

Welcome to our **Tokenization Research Project**, developed by the **TELUS Digital Research Hub Undergraduate Students**. 

This repository hosts our comprehensive study on text tokenization methods, covering **word-, character-, and subword-level** algorithms such as BPE, WordPiece, and Unigram, and extends to discussions on **multilingual, mathematical, and code tokenization.** It examines their efficiency, consistency, semantic preservation, and influence on large language models.

For the complete study and detailed analysis, see [tokenization.md](https://github.com/TDRH-Undergraduate-Students/tokenization/blob/main/tokenization.md). You can also explore the interactive version by uploading [tokenization.ipynb](https://github.com/TDRH-Undergraduate-Students/tokenization/blob/main/tokenization.ipynb)
